<p>Here’s an idea: What if we moved our lives offline?</p>

<p>That’s right. No more YouTube. No Netflix. No emails. No Spotify. No Instagram. No Google, even. No more feeds. No more recommendations.</p>

<p>Why does every aspect of every web app have to be designed to maximally capture your attention and waste your time? How does Silicon Valley transform the one thing that the Internet offers—all the content in the world—into a means to get you hooked and doing nothing productive?</p>

<p>Today’s Internet hacks our psychological systems for desire. We are constantly tricked into believing that we are just one post, one search, or one video away from satisfaction. Not only do we end up hooked online—whether that be on Instagram, YouTube, or a news website—but we also end up feeling more anxious, irritable, and exhausted—like a lab rat whose desire center is purposefully overstimulated so that it is utterly compelled to pull a dummy lever without ever getting an adequate “fix” (oddly specific example, I know).</p>

<p>Users should be in control of technology rather than the other way around. Why does there have to be a feed on YouTube’s homepage? Why couldn’t it just be a search bar, and the feed moved to an “Explore” page elsewhere? And on the “Explore” page why does it have to be an endless, ever-changing feed that hacks our novelty and desire systems? How about something more sensible: just two or three videos that YouTube thinks I would really like. There’s a plethora of content in my YouTube feed, but I noticed that I don’t enjoy most of what’s there—yet I’m still hooked (sensationalistic thumbnails and titles never fail to keep me scrolling!). Why can’t it just cut all the crap and actually recommend content that enriches rather than degrades? Why does YouTube reward high-output creators (often, celebrities and corporate video producers) and punish indie ones, those who fail to have lots of attention-grabbing jump cuts or otherwise specifically appeal to people with five-second attention spans? Why can’t YouTube respect my time? Why does YouTube flood its homepage, its recommendations, and its culture with videos that aspire to emanate the consummatory nature of TikToks? Down with the feeds. Please.</p>

<p>Why does everything online have to exploit novelty? My university’s learning management system, besides being a slow and unfunctional piece of crap, has adopted the ubiquitous tactic for keeping us simultaneously anxious, hooked, and wasting our time: the notification bell. In theory, notifications should be able to alert us to things that we actually want to be notified about: things due soon that we haven’t submitted, synchronous meetings coming up, perhaps. The problem is this notification icon can’t be disabled or configured, and every page that the student accesses course content from is haunted by the notification bell. Combined with the aforementioned slow loading time of every, single link, this only leads to anxiety, frustration, and time wasted, even subconsciously from the cognitive load of notifications. This is a learning management system, for Goodness’s sake. Other than perhaps keeping track of grades and serving as a dropbox for quizzes/assignments, all it has to do is let me access the course PDFs, lecture videos, and whatnot. That’s it! Why can’t navigating this gosh darn learning management system be as distraction-free, fast, and pain free as navigating the file system in Nautilus on my Linux machine? The unconfigurable notification bell is simply ridiculous: it notifies students when grades are released (stressful) as well as when new course content is released (innocuous). The variability in the emotional impact of the notifications just creates additional stress and desire to check notifications</p>

<p>YouTube and my learning management system are just two examples that illustrate how internet technology has lost its way. Websites are designed to keep you on them as long as possible. They scream, “There’s also this piece of content that you need to check out. And this one. And this one. This one too,” constantly and endlessly. Heck, even Google Doodles are designed to get you and others on the site. Google Doodles cannot be disabled, and if you use Chrome, it cannot be removed from the New Tab page (without an extension). The novelty of a new doodle gets your brain’s reward center lighting up, and you click on the doodle, which takes you on a whole elaborate tangent, not a meaningful or enriching one, but one that you are compelled to take anyway. (At least this is the case for me. Yes, I’m easily tempted.)</p>

<p>Sometimes people don’t even realize how much of their issues—anxiety, procrastination, guilt from wasting time—stems from the way websites simply don’t respect mental health or the user’s time. No, checking that Instagram or YouTube feed won’t bring you any satisfaction, even though technology has hacked your dopamine system to convince you otherwise. When I try to take an Internet fast, to disconnect for the day, I invariably end up feeling as if I need to go on YouTube again, to restore some kind of balance, to fulfill some need I’ve been neglecting. Of course this is a lie. Although it seems that satisfaction is right around the corner with an hour on YouTube, what ends up happening is the trigger of dopamine (which creates that desire for YouTube in the first place) with no real satisfaction or true reward. An hour disconnected is a wiser choice, a more fulfilling option, even if it doesn’t feel that way when you’re hooked to the internet. Instead of the novel and numerous content flooding your favourite social media site, just a few really good videos, books, or games, enjoyed offline can be more recharging.

<p>Let’s stay offline unless we truly can’t.</p>
