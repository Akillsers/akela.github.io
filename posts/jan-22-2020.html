     <p>I’m starting a blog, and you’re reading the very first post! My name is Akela Ng and I’m in grade 12 (last year of high school) in Ontario.</p>

     <p class="no-space-after">A few of my interests are:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Physics</li>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>Software development</li>
        <li>Video games</li>
     </ul>
    
     <p>Come to think about it, my interests are intimately connected. Each one is really an extension of my interest in video games. Many genres of games—like platformers, shooters, action-adventures, and simulation games, to name just a few—often implement aspects of classical mechanics. Games that use physics mechanics can be understood and modelled using the language of mathematics. Math is especially important in making a video game, especially ones with 3D graphics, but even some 2D ones too. And of course, games are software, built with cleverly designed code.</p>

     <p>When I was younger, I watched entire playthroughs of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em> on YouTube. Both are phenomenal games, taking the player on an adventure of a lifetime. The player at the beginning and at the end is not at all the same person. There's a transformation, a journey. You start as a little kid in Ocarina of Time, and by the end of the game, you’re an adult who has defeated bosses upon bosses in diverse realms. <em>Brothers</em> has the player searching for a medicine from a far-off land. By the end of the game, the most stoical of players are reduced to tears. I thought about the games and I said, “Wow! I want to make that.”</p>
     
     <p>It never got any further than that. But I did toy around with Unity, among other game-creation tools. I followed a tutorial to create a simple multiplayer shooter, one for a 2D space shooter, and another one for a physics-based game. A project that I abandoned was an instrument tuning game where you have to tune the strings of a viola—I played the viola in school at that time. I also tried to make a tower defense game because I found the game <em>Bloons TD5</em> fascinating.</p>
     
     <p>The summer before grade 11, I made a complete game from scratch (see <a href="https://github.com/Akillsers/apong">source code</a>). It’s seriously nothing to write home about; it’s just a pong clone. Besides, the code is an unmaintainable pile of poop. What’s a little interesting though is that I made a debug overlay system that captures variables each frame and you can play back the game state of the last 500 frames. I used this system to fine-tune the AI.</p>

	 <p>After the pong clone, I started work on a text editor for writing code. But it’s never gotten into any sort of usable state (ugh!). I was too ambitious and pedantic. First, I wanted to support complex script (Arabic, for example, requires complex text handling procedures). I wrote my own implementation of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm and used the Harfbuzz programming library to shape runs of text. After that, getting selection working was another sticking point. I think that selection is still extremely buggy since I last touched it. Then, I wanted to have tabs in the title bar as Chrome or Microsoft Word does. That took many weeks and I think that I just kind of quit at that point.</p>
	 <p>So I decided that starting over was the best thing to do. This time I was going to keep things simple. No tabs in the titlebar and no complex script. No external font code either. I was going to parse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph_Bitmap_Distribution_Format">BDF font files</a> and render fonts myself. To this end, I made Typed. (Naturally, it’s nowhere near complete.) </p>


     <p>Then I decided that I don’t really need a code editor. What I instead needed was a journalling, planning, and calendaring productivity tool. So I copied the code for Typed and made <a href="https://github.com/Akillsers/noted">Noted</a>.</p>


     <p>I haven’t worked on any of these programming projects in the past few months, mainly focusing on school instead. And that takes us to today. We'll I work on more programming type of things in the future? A good part of me wants to.</p>
