     <p>I want to be an outstanding math and physics teacher. As a teacher, I will uphold my responsibility to help every student in their pursuit of knowledge, competence, and moral uprightness. I will be committed to honesty, reason, science, and academic excellence. I will recognize and value the inherent worth of every student. I will treat students with goodwill and refrain from antagonism or hostility beyond what is absolutely necessary.</p>
     <p>In university, I will single-mindedly aim at becoming a great teacher. There is no limit to how deep that my understanding of the mathematical and physical world can be. What if I tried to understand as much math and physics as I can in the next four years? I can do that by religiously working through math and physics textbooks. I will also spend countless hours perusing great books and scholarly journals to learn about the world and the human condition, all the while developing and refining a writerly ear that allows me to speak more precisely and write more cogently. </p>
     <p>I also want to avoid a sedentary lifestyle at all costs. It really doesnâ€™t matter what I do as long as I move and sweat regularly. Exercise slows the deterioration of the brain as one ages, and it enriches life with meaning. Eating healthy allows me to pursue my daily activities with a minimum of hunger, lethargy, and bloating; develop a physique that I can be proud of; and to avoid feelings of remorse for self-indulgence and embarrassment over unsustainable eating habits. I can rely on eating three square meals a day for much-needed consistency and mental and physical stability in my daily routine. I need to eat healthy food like rice, vegetables, egg, meat and fish instead of junk food like bread, added sugar, and margarine. Both exercise and good nutrition enables me to live a long, healthy, empowered life instead of a short, disease-ridden, and miserable one.</p>
