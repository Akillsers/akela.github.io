     <p>What do I want for my career? What are my educational goals? How should I spend my time outside of work? Are there things I can do and <em>would</em> do to take care of my mental and physical health? Now is the best time for me to envision an ideal future.</p>
     
     <h3>Career</h3>
     <p>I want to be a <em>good</em> math and physics teacher. A good teacher is committed to helping every student's pursuit of knowledge, competence, and moral uprightness; to the values of honesty, reason, science, and academic excellence; to the inherent worth of every student; and to acting in goodwill with a genuine desire to make things better.</p>
     
     <h3>Education</h3>
     <p>There’s no limit to one's knowledge of the mathematical and physical world. This is true for humanity collectively, and it is doubly true for an individual like myself. That’s awesome because <em>I want to learn an absolutely ridiculous amount of math and physics in the next four years</em>. There are several reasons for this. First, there's an appealing challenge to this goal. It's difficult. There are plenty of “milestones” that I would like to reach—equations and concepts that I want to be able to use and understand. Examples include Maxwell's equations, Schrödinger’s wave equation, and general relativity. Second, I like math. I like the true and objective way it describes the world. I like systems. I like technical things. Third, being mathematically and technically competent not only enriches life, but opens up opportunities. Math and physics enables you to do <em>things</em>: calculate probabilities, program computer graphics, model phenomena like evolution. Fourth, I am morally obliged to practice what I preach, to care about math and physics as I teach it to high-school students. Great teachers know the importance of what they teach. It is self-evident to them, and, through their teaching, it becomes self-evident to their students.</p>
     <p>There’s also no limit to knowledge of everything else, such as the human condition. I plan to spend countless hours perusing great books and scholarly journals, all the while developing and refining a writerly ear that allows me to speak more precisely and write more cogently. One thing I’m particularly interested in is the psychological field of intelligence, so reading the journal <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/intelligence">Intelligence</a> will be one of the first things I do with my university identity.</p>
     
     <h3>Leisure</h3>
     <p>The application of math and physics that had always excited me the most is video games. I want to dedicate some time to working on a few hobbyist adventure games. I want to create some sort of 2D top-down Zelda-like game first before I make a simple 3D first-person game. Of course, I’m not going to use any game engines.</p>
     <p>Other leisure activities I'd like to pursue include reading, watching YouTube, playing some games (like osu!), physical activites (see next section), and spending time with my dear sister (and perhaps other friends and family members).</p>
     <h3>Health</h3>
     <p>I also want to avoid a sedentary lifestyle at all costs. It really doesn’t matter what I do as long as I move and sweat regularly. Exercise slows the deterioration of the brain as one ages, and it enriches life with meaning. Eating healthy allows me to pursue my daily activities with a minimum of hunger, lethargy, and bloating; develop a physique that I can be proud of; and to avoid feelings of remorse for self-indulgence and embarrassment over unsustainable eating habits. I can rely on eating three square meals a day for much-needed consistency and mental and physical stability in my daily routine. I need to eat healthy food like rice, vegetables, egg, meat and fish instead of junk food like bread, added sugar, and margarine. Both exercise and good nutrition enables me to live a long, healthy, empowered life instead of a short, disease-ridden, and miserable one.</p>
